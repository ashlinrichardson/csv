how to build/ run this code (DONE)

1. make a copy of the bin folder in your private folder

2. using Windows' file manager, open a cygwin terminal at C:\cygwin64\cygwin.bat

3. navigate to your copy of the bin folder..
for example, if it was at R:\user_name\bin
you would type at the prompt:

cd /cygdrive/r/my_user_name/bin

and press return.

4. type:

source bash_profile

and press return

(this tells the prompt to look for commands in the present directory, and tells it where to find python and R)

5. build the programs by typing:

python setup.py

press return
